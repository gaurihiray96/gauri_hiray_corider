## Hello sir/mam, thank you so much for considering my application, please run the above api.py code to run the API which you can test using Postman on port 8080.


First get your database ready using the instruction in this link - 
https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database

Now run api.py.

After that, just sent api requests in json format to the API.


To dockerize - 
docker-compose run --build
docker-compose run
